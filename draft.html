Toni Kroos (born 4 January 1990) is a German professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for La Liga club Real Madrid. Widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time, Kroos plays mainly as a central midfielder, but has also been deployed as a deep-lying playmaker in his career.

With Bayern, Kroos won two consecutive league titles (three titles in total), a UEFA Champions League title, two DFB-Pokal titles, and was voted into the league team of the season three times. In 2014, he joined Real Madrid in a transfer worth €25 million.
